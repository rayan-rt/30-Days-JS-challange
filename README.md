🚀 30 Days JavaScript Challenge – Powered by Chai aur Code ☕
Embarked on an exciting 30-day coding journey led by Sir Hitesh Choudhary a.k.a. Chai aur Code — where JavaScript magic happened every single day! 🔥
Over the month, I explored JavaScript inside-out by:
Building mini-projects to grasp core concepts
Tackling LeetCode problems to sharpen logic
Creating real-world apps like:
🌦️ Weather App
🎬 Movie Search App
💬 Real-time Chat App
✅ ToDo App
🛒 eCommerce
📊 Minimal Social Media Dashboard
This challenge wasn’t just about learning—it was about leveling up, building a strong JS foundation, and having a lot of fun along the way!
